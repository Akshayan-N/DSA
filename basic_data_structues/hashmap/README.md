> [!note] 
> Hash Table is Big Concept to Study. 
>But the main function is that we have a key 🗝️!!
>And the key is hashed using the hash function and we get the index for that is the hash itself 


> [!example] 
> 1. Counting the number of each alphabets in a string.
> 2. For Solving Two Sum in O(N) complexity.
> 3. Password Protection.
> 4.  Checking Anagram.  and more
